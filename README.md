Movie Database Project

This repository houses my movie database project that I made for my CSC 20 - Programming Methodologies II class. 
Similar to IMDB, this command prompt program serves as a queryable database of information about movies. 
The user can read, write, edit, and delete entries. 
There is Input sanitization. 


How It Works
-Command prompt application. 
-Loads movies and information from memory, stored in a .txt file. 
-User input commands.
